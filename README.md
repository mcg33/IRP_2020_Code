# Retinal Determination Network expression in non-retinal tissues - IRP code 2020
The Github repository for Mcg33's IRP 2020, coded in Python3 and stored in .ipynb format to be run in Jupyter Notebooks. 
## Python 3 modules
The Kallisto-Bustools module for Python3 is used for basic QC and cell clustering for all single-cell RNA-sequencing datasets.  
RNA Velocity analysis is run using the scVelo module for Python 3 (*Bergen V*, *et al.,*(2020)) for all relevant datasets.

## Sub-heading in markdown
* This is a bullet point example
* You just need to put an astricks  
Just write normally to get a paragraph.
Not like HTML where you need <p> tages everywhere.
Line breaks are two spaces at the end of text.  
See Line break!
Double astricks makes test **bold**
Single astricks makes words in *italics*
